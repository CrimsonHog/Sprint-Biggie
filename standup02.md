#Standup 2.02


**App (Front/Back end)**

1. Front end almost done
2. Render is up and running
3. Back end (App.js), Crud operators: Create (Almost finished, just tyding up ejs) Read (Finished just have to change it into a function to be called alot) Update/Delete in progress
4. Created issues to keep us on track, seperate from milestones so we know priority on tasks


**Team Members**

Slade: main person working on EJS
Rinke: Main person working on database/api calls

Brody and John: Working on tidying up website, helping with issues that Slade/Rinke come up with
	(Planned to overhaul front end website after we finish up back end and all the calls for front end)





**In class**

Barry said to focus on the crud and app first and foremost, don't have to focus on extra stuff unless we feel good about everything. 

Cards for recipes (Ideas): Have a card popout to allow user to edit, instead of loading an entire new page
			   Could have the card with the recipe just expand instead of going to a seperate page
